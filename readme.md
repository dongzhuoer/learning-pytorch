# Overview

[Deep Learning with PyTorch](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Deep-Learning-with-PyTorch) is a very "good" book to teach oneself PyTorch. Because it's old, incomplete, even with error, and those force you thinking, exploring, therefore learning.

But reproducibility is also very important, sometimes we need code ready for use. That's why I create this repo.


# to do


# open question

- why `only-fc.py` is better than `image-classify.py --only-fc`?
- For resnet, training use dropout, why result is still reproduciable.
